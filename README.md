# Roadmap of Backend Engineering
1. High Level understanding of the Backend Engineering

2. HTTP protocols [communication, headers, http methods-get, put, post, cors flow, http responses, commonly use http codes, catching, catching techniques, content negotiation, compression, persistent connection, security aspects of http]

3. Routing [how routing maps urls, connection bt rounting and http methods, techniques, static, dynamic, reg ex. routes, best practices, grouping, optimizing, securing]

4. Serialization and Deserialization [error handling, security, validation, json schema, performance, ]

5. Authentiacation and Authorization [statful, stateless auth, session, cookies, api keys, multifactor auth, o auth, salting, hashing, a,r,re-back, csrf, audit lagging, monitoring failed login attemps, edge cases, rate limiting, timing attaks]

6. Validation and Transformation [types, syntactic, symantic validation, type validation, serverside validation, failing fast, consistancy, type casting, normalization, sanitizations, complex validation logic, relational-conditional validation, chain validation, error handling, aggregating validation, fail transformations, performance tradeoffs]

7. Middlewares [what, common use cases, roles, flow of middlewares, chain of middlewares, how next fn, 404 errors, security middlewares, cors headers, avoid csrf attacks, route protect, request or structure logging, compression or performance, data passing middleware, performance and scalable aspect of middleware ]

8. Request context [state, lifecycle of request, components, session info, tracking and logging info, use cases, types of timeouts, best practices, avoid tightly coupling]

9. Handlers and controllers [ MVC patterns, services, responcibility, success and error formats]

10. CRUD deepdive [ how, what comm apis, pagination, search, sorting, best practices]

11. REST Best practices [ principle of designing, types of versioning, design apis, exceptions, client side catching]

12. DATABASES [cap theorem, best practices, optimization, concorency, orms, db migrations]

13. Business Logic Layes [ validation, rougting, middleswares, handlers and controllesr are of presentaion layer, Business logic layer, data access layer, design priciples***, components, services, domain models, business tools and logic, handling errors]

14. Catching [need, type, client side and server side catching, catch invalidation, levels of catching , heirarchical catching, for web apps, assets, dbs, query catching, ]

15. Transactional Emails [anatomy, header, footer, subject preheader, cta]

16. Task queuing and scheduling [usercases, db backups, maintanance, comps of task queue, flow of task dependency, handle errors, task prioritization]

17. Elastic Search [techniques, user cases, optimize search performance, boosting, filtering aggregation, best practices, opt chats]

18. Error handling [ types of errors, strategies, practices, logging errors, user facing errors, monitoring and logging in error handling, email and slag based errors]

19. Config Management [what?, how it help, use cases, safe data management, best practices, types of configs, sources of configs, ]

20. Logging, monitoring, and Observability [differeces, types, levels, best practices - logs, types, tools - moni, 3 pillers of obese, ]

21. Graceful shutdown [why?, use cases, signal handling, STEPS,]

22. Security [different aspects, priciples, importance, polices, cors, cookies]

23. Scaling and Performance [different metrix of performance, responce time, catching, db optimization, lazy loading, db indexex, avoid memory leaks, minimizing network overload, clear and maintanable code, offload non critical task, ]

24. Concurrency and Parallelism [differece, io and cpu bound task]

25. Object storage and Large files [database3, ]

26. Realtime Backend systems [websockets, servers and events]

27. Testing and code quality [types of testing, Test driven development, measures of code quality, psyclomatic complexity, maintain a code]

28. 12 factor app Principles

29. OpenAPI standards [need, why, benifits, use cases, ecosystem, swagger, versions, key conceps, structure, api first development]

30. Webhooks [what, use cases, server initiated, sig varification, logging, test, etc]

31. DevOps for backend engineers [CI/CD, infra is code, tooks, containers, ci/cd pipelines, deployment strategies]
